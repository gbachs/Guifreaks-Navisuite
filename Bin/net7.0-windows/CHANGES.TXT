Must haves (or bugs)
- RTL text rendering fix (appears behind image)

Should have (must have features)
- Arabic translation

Could have (nice to haves)

- Change the height of the navigation popup
- Reordering GroupView inside the band
- NavigationBar button options with right click menu
- Support for cut, copy and paste (design time) 
- Add an option to show/hide the [navigation pane options] menu item inside the more options menu, in case you don't want to allow the user to change the buttons order.
- Hide the separator under the [Add or remove buttons] menuitem when we don't have any overflow buttons.
- Open the options form either center screen or center parent
- Change the show more options button text to match the text used in MS Outlook (in letters case), that would be:
	• Show More Buttons
	• Show Fewer Buttons
	• Navigation Pane Options... (Instead of "options of the navigation pane". This would be used as the title of the options forms as well)
	• Add or Remove Buttons
